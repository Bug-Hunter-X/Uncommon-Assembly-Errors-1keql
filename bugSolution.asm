To mitigate these issues:

* **Bounds checking:** Always check array indices before accessing memory to ensure they are within the valid range.  Implement error handling for out-of-bounds accesses.

* **Input validation:** Carefully validate all user inputs, especially those affecting memory addresses or offsets, to prevent buffer overflows and other memory corruption issues. Consider using safe functions to prevent potential overflow from occurring. 

* **Control flow validation:** Validate addresses before jumping to them using the `jmp` instruction.  Implement mechanisms to prevent code execution from arbitrary memory locations, such as using address space layout randomization (ASLR). 

* **Memory management:** Use appropriate memory management techniques to allocate and deallocate memory properly to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers. Employ techniques such as stack canaries and address space layout randomization (ASLR) to improve security. 

The `bugSolution.asm` file demonstrates these solutions.  Remember that meticulous code review and rigorous testing are crucial to prevent these errors and maintain program stability and security.
